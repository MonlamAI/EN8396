On May morning


Now the bright morning Stars, Days harbinger,
Comes dancing from the East, and leads with her
The Flowery may, who from her green lap throws. 
The yellow Cowslip, and the Primrose. 
Hail bounteous May that dost inspire. 
Mirth and youth, and warm desire. 
Woods and Groves, are of thy dressing.  
Hill and Dale,Doth boast thy blessing. 
Thus we salute thee with our early song,
And welcome thee, and with thee long.
